This post tells you what is YUV color space and it's sub-categories.

## üåÅ YUV Color Space

YUV defines each pixel has:

- one Y (_luminance_) vector
- two _chrominance_ vectors, where..
    - U is _blue projection_
    - V is _red projection_

**luminance**:

**chrominance** (red and blue projection):

## üîç Common YUV formats

### YUV4:4:4

Each pixel contains `Y`, `U` and `V` compoments and each compoments are `1 byte`.

### YUV4:2:2

Each 2 horizontal pixels contains 2 Y, 1 U and V compoments and both pixels share the same U and V

### YUV4:2:0

Each 2 `horizontal` and 2 `vertical` pixels (total 4 pixels) contains 4 `Y`, 1 `U ` and 1 `V` compoments and four pixels share the same `U` and `V`.

### YUV4:1:1

Each 2 `horizontal` and 2 `vertical` pixels (total 4 pixels) contains 4 `Y`, 1 `U ` and 1 `V` compoments and four pixels share the same `U` and `V`.
